Programming Challenge Description:
You are given a positive integer number. This represents the sales made that day in your department store. The payables department however, needs this printed out in English. NOTE: The correct spelling of 40 is Forty. (NOT Fourty)
Input:
Your program should read lines of text from standard input. Each line contains a positive integer.
Output:
For each set of input print a single line to standard output which is the english textual representation of that integer. The output should be unspaced and in CamelCased. Always assume plural quantities. You can also assume that the numbers are < 1000000000 (1 billion). In case of ambiguities eg. 2200 could be TwoThousandTwoHundredDollars or TwentyTwoHundredDollars, always choose the representation with the larger base i.e. TwoThousandTwoHundredDollars.
